# PokeSpotter

PokeSpotter is a Pokemon Go inspiration that allows the user to populate the map with random Pokemons, which then extends to Apple Maps to navigate the user to a Pokemon's exact location.

This app uses CocoaPods to manage 3rd party Softwares/Libaries such as Firebase for Backend and Database services and Alamofire for HTTP Network calls to the Pokemon API, CoreLocation to access the user's current location, and MapKit to display user and Pokemon annotations at specific locations.

Future updates may include: 
    1. An option to read up on some facts about a Pokemon before deciding on whether you want to go and find it.
    2. Giving the user more control on what Pokemons should populate the map. Not sure about this because random Pokemons might be morefun.
