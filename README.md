# PokeSpotter

This app uses Firebase for Backend and Database services, CoreLocation to access the user's current location, and MapKit to display user and Pokemons annotations at specific locations.

A Pokemon Go add-on that allows the user to populate the map with random Pokemons, which then extends to Apple Maps to navigate the user to a Pokemon's exact location.

Future updates may include: 
    1. An option to read up on some facts about a Pokemon before deciding on whether you want to go and find it.
    2. Giving the user more control on what Pokemons should populate the map. Not sure about this because random Pokemons might be morefun.
